Table S1 contains the details of published Saccharoyces cerevisiae isolates used as presence data for the MaxEnt analysis detailed in Section 4.7.2. . In considering the inclusion of published strains, potentially mobile human and animal hosted strains were omitted due to their mobility,and  vineyard associated, agricultural and other industrial strains due to their potentially recent introduction to their isolation sites. Those listed as originating from mountainous sites where climate data varies heavily over small distances were also omitted, along with others with location information that could not be defined to within 10km. After this filtering, the following table was compiled including 344 reported S. cerevisiae isolates from a total of 12 studies as follows:

Almeida et al. 2015
Cromie et al. 2013
Faparusi, 1973
Fay and Benavides, 2005
Hounhouigan et al. 1993
Knight et al. 2015
Liti et al. 2009
Mortimer & Johnston, 1986

Table S2 contains the details of published Saccharoyces paradoxus isolates used as presence data for the MaxEnt analysis detailed in Section 4.7.2. In considering the inclusion of published strains, agriculturally associated strains were omitted due to their potentially recent introduction to their isolation sites. Those listed as originating from mountainous sites where climate data varies heavily over small distances were also omitted, along with others with location information that could not be defined to within 10km. After this filtering, the following table was compiled including 362 reported S. paradoxus isolates as follows:

Almeida, 2001
Glushakova et al. 2007
Kuehne et al. 2007
Leducq et al. 2014
Liti et al. 2009
Maganti et al. 2011
